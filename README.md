AWS Multi-AZ EC2 Deployment with HashiCorp's Terraform
Description:
This GitHub repository contains the Terraform scripts necessary to deploy multiple EC2 instances across different Availability Zones (AZs) in AWS. Designed to showcase a robust, scalable architecture, these scripts leverage HashiCorp Terraform to automate the creation of infrastructure, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

Features:

Multi-AZ Deployment: Enhances the resilience and availability of applications by distributing EC2 instances across multiple, geographically separated availability zones.
Automation: Utilizes Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC), enabling repeatable and consistent deployments.
Scalability: Easily scale your EC2 instances up or down based on demand, directly from the configuration files.
Customization: Parameterized scripts allow for easy adjustments to instance sizes, AZ distributions, and more.
Getting Started:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Terraform installed and configured with your AWS credentials.
Deployment: Clone this repository, update the variables as per your requirement, and run the Terraform scripts to provision your infrastructure.
Usage:

Detailed instructions on deploying and managing your instances are available in the repository's README.
Contributing:
Contributions to enhance the functionality, add features, or improve the reliability of the deployment scripts are welcome. Please submit pull requests for review.
